	See what changes client wants in solutions.php
	See what changes client wants in services.php
	See what changes client wants in contact.php
	See what changes client wants in join_form.php
	
## 2. Bugs – representing work to address a defect

	Increase speed of mail() php delivery.

## 3. Chores – representing work that must be done, but provide no direct business value
	
	Encapsulation of join_confirmation.php
	Encapsulation of activation.php
	Encapsulation of login.php
	Encapsulation of session.php
 	Encapsulation of test_input.php

## 4. Epics – representing big user stories. Originally defined as too big to fit in an iteration (the equivalent of a Scrum sprint)

## 5. Prototypes (a form of risk mitigation) – representing proof of concepts that help provide information for decision making around whether some functionality may be valuable
